### Hi, I’m Rohan 👋

I’m a backend-first full stack engineer focused on building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and practical to run in production.

Most of my day-to-day work lives in private enterprise repositories.  
The projects here reflect the kinds of problems I enjoy working on outside of work — workflow orchestration, backend reliability, and operational tooling — using the same patterns and standards I apply professionally.

**Core focus**
- Java & Spring Boot microservices
- Workflow orchestration and backend systems
- Angular-based operational interfaces
- Cloud-hosted, production-oriented applications

I value clear design, boring reliability, and software that behaves well under real-world constraints.
